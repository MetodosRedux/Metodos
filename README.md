In case of needing to update three.js:
run gulp in terminal
change  dist/mjs/BufferGeometryUtils,
        dist/mjs/GLTFLoader,
        dist/mjs/OrbitControls 
        'three' imports to './three.module.js'
        and change second import in GLTFLoader to be: import toTrianglesDrawMode from './BufferGeometryUtils.js';
